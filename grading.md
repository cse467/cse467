## Class attendance


**In-class quizzes: 25% (26 quizz)**  <br /> Short Quizzes will be administered at the beginning or end of almost every lecture (excluding Lecture 1). They will be short, and mainly aimed at making sure that you were able to follow the material covered during the Lecture on that day or the previous day. The worst-performing 1 Quiz across all lectures will not count towards your grade


**Assignments 40%**  <br />There will be 4 homework assignments and will involve various tasks: programming, mathematical problem solving, designing system prototypes following privacy and security principles, explaining concepts taught in the course, and so on. Written assignments will be graded based on the clarity and validity of your arguments and analysis following the rubric at the end of this page. You can submit one assignment up to 48 hours late without any penalty. 10% points will be subtracted for every 24-hours delay.


**Term project 35%**  <br />Teams of 2–4 students will work on a novel, potentially impactful, and interesting **research** project. The project should involve any combination of the activities: implementing prototypes, conducting experiments, collecting and analyzing data, literature review, and so on. You will submit a report describing your research, results, and conclusions. The project will be graded based on -
* Importance of the problem studied/potential impact of the solution
* Novelty of the problem or solution, or both
* Scientific validity of the methodology, how well you conducted your research,  the completeness of your work
* Quality of the writing, your ability to motivate your research, clarity in presenting the methods, drawing conclusions from your results, synthesizing knowledge and contextualizing findings from prior research, as well as its conciseness (see the end-of-page rubrics).


## Project milestones 
You will complete the project in multiple milestones, and each milestone will be graded *independently* of the other parts. </br>
1)  **Proposal (5):**  By the end of Week 3, submit a short (2-page max) proposal of the project. Content:
    * Name of project team and names of students on the team
    * Problem statement, Research questions and hypotheses (if any), or expected contribution
    * Study methods: Prototyping, Data Analysis, Survey or Interview, and so on.
    * If implementation-focused, explain what technology/resources you will use, how you will evaluate the implemented system?
    * Data collection: describe the type of quantitative and/or qualitative data you expect to collect, if you plan to conduct user studies, how will you develop the questionnaire?
    * Data analysis: what quantitative and/or qualitative approaches do you expect to use to analyze your data
    * Collaboration plan: How often will the team meet? How will you communicate? How do you expect to divide up the work?
    
    
2)  **Intermediate project report (10):** Provide a progress report (max 3-pages) with intermediate results by the end of Week 8. <ins> By that time, you should be able to complete at least 30% of what you had proposed to do</ins>. Explain unresolved issues and challenges, how will you resolve them? Provide a timeline to complete the remaining tasks and write the project report. How will you distribute the workload among the team members?


3)  **Final report (20):**  Extend the status report with all results, discuss,interpret, and contextualize the results, and draw conclusions from them. 


**Note:**  Intermediate/Final Report should be written following the [Latex](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip) or [Word](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx) template, and will be a single column document, maximum 4 pages long (excluding references and clearly marked appendices). 



## Tips about the final project
* You should start thinking about the final project very soon and form a team with those who have similar interests.
* Some projects from another similar course have been listed in canvas that you can use as examples of interesting topics.
* You may find ideas for possible project topics by “glancing ahead” at the course’s topics for future weeks. If some topic seems interesting but you are not very familiar with it, talk with me or the TAs.
* You may also find ideas by checking websites such as EPIC (consumer rights advocacy group: http://www.epic.org/) or IAPP (Privacy consortium: http://www.privacyassociation.org/), or Common Sense Media (https://www.commonsense.org/).

## Bonus points and assignment revisions
* 1 bonus point when you get at least 5 likes/thanks for answering a question posted on discord/canvas about the course material or homeworks (note, you may discuss difficulties you are facing when working on a  homework, e.g., setting up the programming environment, but cannot post solutions or steps to solve a problem). You can earn this point multiple times over the semester.
* 1 bonus point for asking a thought-provoking question during the lecture. You can earn this point multiple times over the semester.
* 1 bonus point if you submit a homework assignment at least one hour before the deadline. You can earn this point multiple times over the semester.
* You can revise and resubmit one homework assignment within 2 weeks of the initial deadline to improve your score (up to 90% of the full marks for that assignment)

# Course overview

This course is intended to provide students with an introductory understanding of the technical and behavioral mechanisms for information security and privacy. Students will learn how the security and privacy of information can be attacked, and what are the current mitigation strategies in each case. In a semester-long project, students will learn how to apply best practices to enhance privacy and security of a computing system while keeping it usable for the consumers.

# Prerequisites
Students need to have knowledge of
- Linear algebra
- Basic Calculus
- Basic Statistics and Probability Theory
- Algorithms and Data structures
- Basics of database systems
- Python/R programming language (or willingness to learn on their own)

## Course materials
We will follow chapters from multiple books, including
Introduction to Computer Security, Matt Bishop, ISBN: 0321247442
The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy, by Cynthia Dwork and Aaron Roth
We will make use of many other online resources including tutorials and frameworks:

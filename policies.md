## Class attendance
Regular class attendance and participatio are required, unless pre-approved by the instructor or in case of emergency. There will be a sign-in poll at the start of class every day, and in-class quizzes. If a student arrives late, they may not get attendance credit for that class and quiz. Please arrive on time and ready to participate by the scheduled start time. 


**Important.** Excused absences for classes will be given without penalty to the grade in the case of (1) a university-sanctioned event [ACD 304-02]; (2) religious holidays [ACD 304-04]; a list can be found here https://eoss.asu.edu/cora/holidays ]; (3) work performed in the line-of-duty according [SSM 201-18]; Excused absences do not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence.

## Late submission policy for assignments
Start early and plan your time well. To account for unavoidable issues, students will get a 2-day extensions for *one of the assignments* without asking me. This should be reserved for an emergency, **there will be no further extension** unless prior approval. 

## Course project
Students will work on privacy-related projects in groups of 4-5 students. Each group will prepare a project report and a poster to present their work.

## Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty
This is a research-oriented course where collaboration is welcomed. But provide credit where it's due.
Plagiarism or any form of cheating in assignments or projects is subject to serious academic penalty. Students in this class must adhere to ASUâ€™s academic integrity policy, which can be found at https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy. Students are responsible for reviewing this policy and understanding each of the areas in which academic dishonesty can occur. In addition, all engineering students are expected to adhere to the ASU Academic Integrity Honor Code. All academic integrity violations are reported to the Fulton Schools of Engineering Academic Integrity Office (AIO). The AIO maintains a record of all violations and has access to academic integrity violations committed in all other ASU colleges/schools.

You may engage in intellectual discussions about reading assignments with your peers or me, but all submissions must be your own, based on your understanding of the content. Your project report will resemble academic scholarly articles, where you must credit all sources, including your partners in brainstorming, published papers, and existing code repositories (e.g., from stackoverflow or github) that you have used in your implementation. Posting your projects online, including using a public Github repo, is expressly forbidden. The Github Student Developer Pack provides unlimited private repositories while you are a student.

## Title IX
Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited. An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university. If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs.
As mandated reporters, we are obligated to report any information we become aware of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence. ASU Counseling Services, https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling is available if you wish to discuss any concerns confidentially and privately. ASU online students may access 360 Life Services, https://goto.asuonline.asu.edu/success/online-resources.html.

## Disability Accommodations
Suitable accommodations are made for students having disabilities. Students needing accommodations must register with the ASU Disabilities Resource Center and provide documentation of that registration to the instructor. Students should communicate the need for an accommodation in enough time for it to be properly arranged. See ACD 304-08 Classroom and Testing Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
